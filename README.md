# Introduction

Mysore is meant to become an open-source implementation of the
transactional record manager based on the Hyder
[paper](http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2011/Papers/CIDR11_Paper2.pdf)
release 2009 by Microsoft Corp.

# Progress

Currently I just started to project so next up so set up a basic file
structure and getting the module split right. Then main components
will be written (multi-version btree, tnx manager, etc.) Finally, a
first simple implementation might be tackled.

# Background 

[Mysore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore) is a large city in
India. The name  was chosen in analogy to
[Hyder Ali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyder_Ali) ruler of the 
kingdom of Mysore. I am not even sure if that was the original
intention by the researchers at Microsoft, but Mysore fullfils all
criterias of a good product name: ASCII, short, catchy sounding ;-)

# Introduction

Mysore is meant to become an open-source implementation of the transactional
record manager based on the Hyder
[paper](http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2011/Papers/CIDR11_Paper2.pdf) release 2009 by
Microsoft Corp. and presented during the CIDR 2011 conference.

# Progress

Need to get the module split right. Then main components will be written
(multi-version btree, tnx manager, etc.) Finally, a first simple implementation
might be tackled.

# Background 

[Mysore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore) is a large city in India. The name
was chosen in analogy to [Hyder Ali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyder_Ali)
ruler of the kingdom of Mysore. I am not even sure if that was the original
intention by the researchers at Microsoft, but Mysore fullfils all criterias of
a good product name: ASCII, short, catchy sound.
